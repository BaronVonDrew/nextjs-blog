So, I built this blog page using **Next.js** as a framework, and I have to say, it's pretty good.

The example is sufficiently simple to allow it to focus on the **basics** of Next.js, while giving you enough examples to get going. 

The tutorial suggests to me that they've built it mostly around serving static sites, and the options for server-side and client side rendering are _advanced_ usages, but perhaps that's just to simplify the demo. 

On the whole I found it pretty straightforward and will probably use it as a quick and easy way to start a react App in future. I haven't yet used it in anger to do anything more complicated so we'll see how that goes.
